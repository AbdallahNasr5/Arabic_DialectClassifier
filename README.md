# Arabic_DialectClassifier
This repository is a Python implementation for Arabic Dialect Classificaiton based on the dataset in [link to paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06557)

## Dataset
The dataset contains a wide range of country-level Arabic dialects retrieved from Twitter â€”covering 18 different countries in the Middle East and North Africa region.The
resultant dataset contains 540k tweets from 2,525 users who are evenly distributed across 18 Arab countries.

## Data Pre-processing
Removing the username tag,emojis,URL,punctuation using Regular Expression, and emoji library, Removing stop words from the text to eliminate the low-level information and give the model the ability to focus on the important information using NLTK library.

## Machine Learning Model [Link to notebook](https://github.com/AbdallahNasr5/Arabic_DialectClassifier/blob/main/Arabic_DialectClassifier/MachineLearning_Model.ipynb)
After training multiple models to choose the final model to train the whole data on, LinearSVC shined the most out of all other models.
-Using TF-IDF vectorization to transform the data with respect to word count and importance.

## DeepLearning models using keras embeddings [link to notebook](https://github.com/AbdallahNasr5/Arabic_DialectClassifier/blob/main/Arabic_DialectClassifier/DeepLearning_Model.ipynb)
In this section we used 2 architictures, CNN and CNN&LSTM pipeline.
The CNN model outperformed the CNN&LSTM model for this task with the same number of parameters.

## DeepLearning model with word2vector embedding [link to notebook](https://github.com/AbdallahNasr5/Arabic_DialectClassifier/blob/main/Arabic_DialectClassifier/Word_To_Vector_DLModel.ipynb)
In this notebook we trained a word2vector model and used it in the embedding layer after converting it to a matrix with respect to the training set corpus.

# Conclusion
The model that outperformed is the LinearSVC model with the highest f1 scores and accuracy score of 53%
